# MatchMesh

A fault-tolerant distributed matchmaking cluster: five C++20 nodes, gRPC,
consistent hashing, primary-backup replication and chaos testing.

> Work in progress — currently at Phase 1 (toolchain and repository setup).

## Quick start (development container)

```bash
# 1. Build the dev image (once, or whenever the Dockerfile changes)
docker build -t matchmesh-dev .

# 2. Open a shell inside it, with this folder mounted at /workspace
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/workspace matchmesh-dev

# 3. Inside the container: configure, build, run
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
./build/debug/node/matchmesh_node
```

Build presets: `debug`, `release`, `tsan` (ThreadSanitizer).

## Service contracts

The gRPC APIs live in [`proto/matchmesh/v1/`](proto/matchmesh/v1) (package `matchmesh.v1`).
C++ code is generated from them at build time into `build/<preset>/proto/gen/`
and compiled into the `matchmesh_proto` library.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `common.proto` | Shared types: `Player`, `QueueKey` (the shard key: region, game mode, skill bracket), `Lobby` |
| `matchmaking.proto` | `MatchmakingService`: `Enqueue`, `Cancel`, `GetLobby` (clients → any node) |
| `cluster.proto` | `ClusterService`: `Heartbeat`, `Replicate`, `GetTopology` (node ↔ node, gateway) |

## Smoke test

Proves two containers can reach each other over gRPC. Run on your machine, from the repo root,
after building the dev image:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

It starts `node-a` as a server and has `node-b` send it a `Heartbeat` ping.
